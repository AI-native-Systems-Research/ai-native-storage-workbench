"""scorer_kani.py — the Kani REPRODUCTION GATE. Reproduction, not declaration.

The proving agent NEVER writes `kani.status`. This scorer does — by executing
the artifacts. It is read-only to the agent at run time.

For every verifiable property it computes exactly one of a tiny closed set:
    proved        — scorer ran the named harness and it reported VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL.
                    Evidence (harness, result, unwind, wall_clock_s, peak_rss_mb) is
                    CAPTURED FROM THE RUN, never typed by the agent. Anti-vacuity:
                    if a `__mutant` harness exists it must go RED, else the proof is vacuous.
    tool-boundary — scorer ran the FULL lever battery for the observed failure class and
                    every lever still failed, AND the residual signature is NOT a known
                    defeat. Signature captured from stderr by the scorer.
    delegated     — a resolvable referent exists (named component + concrete obligation).
    UNRESOLVED    — everything else (no harness, agent lied about a pass, missing lever,
                    signature matches a known defeat, unclassifiable failure). The gate
                    FAILS if any verifiable property is UNRESOLVED.

Usage:
    scorer_kani.py <verif_dir> [--yaml unified_properties.yaml] [--component-dir DIR]
                   [--gate-dir DIR] [--dry-run] [--only ID[,ID...]] [--cap-seconds N]

--dry-run: do NOT invoke cargo kani. Validates artifact existence + battery
completeness + registry matching only, and reports what WOULD run. Use it to see

    `--harness verify_epo_inv_stale_handle_never_crashes` ran three harnesses —

    the property was scored `proved`. That obligation is provably false: its negation is
    machine-proved in Creusot and its Kani refutation passes. So the gate was awarding `proved`
    to a real defect, which is the worst failure this gate can have.

    Kani's terse output brackets each run as `Checking harness <path>::<name>...` followed by that
    harness's `VERIFICATION:- RESULT`. Attribute verdicts per harness and return only the one

    TWO THINGS MADE THIS A FUNCTION RATHER THAN INLINE CODE, both found on
    eviction-policy-session-lists (2026-09-28):

    1. The check used to live only on the unwinding-checks-ON success path. The known-defeat branch
       that applies `--no-unwinding-checks` returned "proved" directly and NEVER ran the mutant, so
       EVERY `bounded-shallow` proof bypassed anti-vacuity entirely. Blast radius when found: 63
       ALREADY-PUBLISHED proved cells (eviction-policy-optimized 58, extended-metadata-store 5).
       Same class as the Creusot mutant-lookup defect — the check existed, a whole population never
       reached it. One helper, called from every path that can return "proved", is the fix.

    2. `extra` is not optional bookkeeping, it is the correctness of the comparison.
       `--no-unwinding-checks` PRUNES paths, it does not merely truncate them, so a harness can pass
       with no content: measured on that component, every `verify_*` passed AND 36 `__mutant` twins
       passed too. If the base proved with `--unwind 4 --no-unwinding-checks` and the mutant is run
       WITHOUT those flags, the mutant may fail on the unwinding assertion rather than because of the
       mutation — which satisfies anti-vacuity for the wrong reason and hides exactly the vacuity
       being hunted. The mutant must run under the SAME flags as the proof it is vouching for.
