"""scorer_creusot.py — the Creusot REPRODUCTION GATE. Reproduction, not declaration.

Mirror of scorer_kani.py for Creusot/why3. The proving agent NEVER writes
`creusot.status`. This scorer does — by RE-RUNNING `cargo creusot <module>`, which
regenerates the .coma FROM SOURCE and discharges that module's goals with the
configured provers. It is read-only to the agent at run time.

ANTI-TAMPER (measured 2026-09-16): cargo skips recompiling when src is unchanged,
so a hand-edited .coma can fake a `Proved`. This scorer `touch`es every src/**.rs
once at startup, forcing creusot-rustc to regenerate every .coma from source before
any judgement. A tampered .coma is overwritten and the real goal is proved or fails.

For every verifiable property it computes exactly one of a tiny closed set:
    proved        — scorer ran the module (base, a scorer-applied lever escalation, or an
                    agent-written lever variant) and `cargo creusot` reported it Proved.
                    Evidence (module, result, wall_clock_s, peak_rss_mb, lever) is CAPTURED
                    FROM THE RUN. Anti-vacuity: a `verify_<ID>__mutant` module, if present,
                    MUST fail, else the property is vacuous.
    tool-boundary — one of two earned routes:
                    (a) BATTERY-EXHAUSTED: scorer ran the FULL lever battery for the observed
                        failure class (prover portfolio + budget + split_vc itself, plus every
                        required code-lever variant the agent supplied) and each still failed,
                        AND the residual signature is NOT a known defeat; OR
                    (b) NOT-EXPRESSIBLE: the property cited an ACTIVE construct in
                        inexpressible_creusot.yaml (creusot.claims_inexpressible: <id>) whose
                        documented type-model authority the scorer CONFIRMED by building that
                        construct's canonical probe in an isolated crate and observing the
                        model-predicted translate/ICE signature. Disjoint from known_defeats;
                        a probe that instead PROVES, or a matching normal proof module, scores
                        the property `proved` (claim rejected, no penalty).
    delegated     — a resolvable referent exists (named component + concrete obligation).
    UNRESOLVED    — everything else (no module, tamper/lie, missing required lever variant,
                    signature matches a known defeat, translate error = broken crate,
                    unclassifiable failure). The gate FAILS if any property is UNRESOLVED.

Usage:
    scorer_creusot.py <verif_dir> [--yaml unified_properties.yaml] [--crate-dir DIR]
                      [--gate-dir DIR] [--dry-run] [--only ID[,ID...]] [--cap-seconds N]

--dry-run: do NOT invoke cargo creusot. Validates module existence + battery
completeness + registry matching only. Use it to watch the gate fail-closed
instantly over a whole component before spending compute.
