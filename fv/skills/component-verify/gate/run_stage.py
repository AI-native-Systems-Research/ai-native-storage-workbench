"""run_stage.py — unattended stage-runner for the component-verify pipeline.

Wraps ONE heavy stage (a scorer, a render, any command) with the robustness rails an
unattended, shareable run needs. It does NOT decide verdicts — the wrapped command's own
exit code is propagated; the scorers remain the gate. It only makes running them safe to
leave alone, and legible to a colleague reading the console afterwards:

  * SENTINEL markers on stdout — `START` / `DONE exit=<n>` / `WATCHDOG-KILL` — so a Monitor
    (or a human) can tell unambiguously when the stage began, ended, and with what code.
  * a WATCHDOG wall budget      — if the child outlives it, its WHOLE process tree is
    SIGKILLed (by process group), not just the direct child, and the stage reports 124.
    (Per-harness caps live in the scorers; this is the backstop for the scorer itself
    hanging, e.g. wedged in Python or a pipe.)
  * a readable per-run LOG      — the child's merged stdout+stderr is teed to --log AND to
    this process's stdout, so the full transcript survives for audit.
  * a completion MARKER file    — written with the exit code + duration on ANY outcome, a
    durable signal the orchestrator reads for resumability ("did this stage finish?").

Usage:
  run_stage.py --name kani-scorer --log <c>/verif/.run/kani.log --watchdog 1800 \
               [--marker <c>/verif/.run/.stage_kani.done] -- python3 gate/scorer_kani.py ...
