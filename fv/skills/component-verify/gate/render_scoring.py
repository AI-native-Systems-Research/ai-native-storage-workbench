"""render_scoring.py — Role 3. Render the ONE combined per-component scoring page
from the reconciled unified_properties.yaml. Renders; does NOT extract/bundle/prove.

Reads status/evidence written by scorer_{kani,creusot}.py (reproduction gate).
Absence of a `status` key in a tool block = PENDING (·), rendered honestly with an
INCOMPLETE banner — never treated as a failure.

Layout (per the September 2026 page design + the user's drill-down order):
  1. How-we-rate + legend
  2. Per-method scorecard, ONE table per tool — # | method | proved / B | rating |
     what's left. The fraction is NATIVE-proved (✓/★) over bundle size B; a method
     with a delegated/boundary/pending property is `partially proved` for that tool.
  3. The partial ones — every partially-proved method drilled down to the exact
     properties still open and their disposition (⤴ delegated / ⊘ boundary / · pending).
  4. Per-property table — every obligation with the per-tool symbol.
  5. Delegations, 6. tool-boundary causes, 7. measurement, 8. anti-vacuity/provenance.

N-tool-ready: one column/section per tool in `tools` (defaults to creusot,kani).
Usage: render_scoring.py <verif_dir> [--yaml unified_properties.yaml] [--out PATH]

    wrote its surprises as records. For those, `proved` CONFIRMS the defect and `refuted` shows the

    The classification lives in an optional top-level `polarity:` map ({id: {polarity, why}}). Only
